# Programming Assignments and Lecture Materials by Andrew Davis

The resources in this repository are assignments designed by myself 
for computer science programming courses.  They also include some
lecture materials.  Solutions to assignments are available upon request
provided that the requester can show evidence that they are an
instructor.
